# The Oval App
## Ansible Deploy Overview
The server deployment uses Ansible for the three application components:
* DB (Postgres)
* Application Server (uWSGI)
* Web Server (nginx)

The ansible playbook is written for RHEL7 based distributions (CentOS, SciLi, etc) and Ubuntu 16.04.  It _may_ work for Ubuntu 14.04 and RHEL6, but there are a few systemd dependent tasks.

## Roles/Profiles
The three application components are divided in Ansible roles:
* [db](roles/db) 
* [app](roles/app) 
* [web](roles/web) 

Both postgres and nginx are installed from the "upstream" apt/yum repos (instead of the base CentOS or Ubuntu repos).  This provides a semi-consistent experience between across operating systems.

There is a fourth [base](roles/base) role that applies to _all_ hosts.  This base role includes stuff like ntp, certbot, additional ssh keys, etc.

## Networking
All `WEB <-> APP <-> DB` traffic occurs over the network using TLS v1.2.  Firewalld is used to expose the DB and uWSGI to (only) the application servers and web servers respectively.

By default, all application servers will connect to the **first** database server listed in the `[db]` ansible group.  The current deployment is designed to utilize a single postgres DB instance.  Multiple DB servers can be deployed, however, only the first DB server will be used by the application servers.


## Inventory File

The default `site.yml` playbook will apply each role to the similarly named ansible group.  E.g. any hosts in the `[db]` ansible group will receive the `db` role.  An example inventory file with 7 hosts:
 * 1 x CentOS 7 database (postgres) server
 * 2 x Ubuntu 16.04 application (uwsgi) servers
 * 2 x CentOS 7 web (nginx) servers
 * 2 x Ubuntu 16.04 web (nginx) servers
```
[db]
db1.example.com	ansible_user=root 

[app]
app1.example.com ansible_user=root ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
app2.example.com ansible_user=root ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

[web]
web1.example.com ansible_user=root 
web2.example.com ansible_user=root 
web3.example.com ansible_user=root ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
web4.example.com ansible_user=root ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
```

Any servers that use python3 by default (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04) **must** have the `ansible_python_interpreter` variable set to `/usr/bin/python3`.



## Variables
### Global Variables
All variables are defined in [group_vars/all/vars.yml](group_vars/all/vars.yml) whereas all sensitive variables are stored in an encrypted ansible vault in [group_vars/all/vault.yml](group_vars/all/vault.yml).  For readability / searchability, sensitive variables (stored in `vars.yml` reference the corresponding `vault_` prefixed variable (stored in `vault.yml`) following [ansible best practices](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_best_practices.html#variables-and-vaults).  

Some application components (like the postgres version) can be overridden by these variables.  By default postgres 9.6 is installed/configured. However, overriding the `postgres_version` variable will change this behavior.

There are application "environment" specific settings (google analytics keys, strava tokens, etc) that can be modified by changing `oval_environment` to `PRD`, `TST` or `DEV`.  The `PRD` environment is set as the default.

### SSL certificates
In order to avoid any Let's Encrypt (certbot) [certificate generation limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/), set `oval_environment` to `DEV` or `TST`. All non `PRD` environments will use the certbot staging server which is **not** subject to these rate limits.  However, these non `PRD` certificates will **not** be trusted by most browsers by default.


### Operating System Specific Variables
CentOS/Ubuntu specific variables are stored in [group_vars/os_RedHat.yml](group_vars/os_RedHat.yml) and [group_vars/os_Debian](group_vars/os_Debian.yml) respectively.

Some packages (e.g. `python-devel` vs. `python-dev`) are named differently between distributions. These OS specific config files normalize variable names.


## Usage
Assuming a proper ansible inventory file is in place, use the `ansible-playbook` command to run the `site.yml` playbook using the `--ask-vault-pass` switch.


Example usage
```
[user@ansible-client oval-ansible]$ ansible-playbook site.yml --ask-vault-pass
Vault password:

## Limitations
* The ansible scripts do not populate the DB with any data (e.g. admins, races, riders, etc), WIP
* A manual reboot might be required if SELinux is flipped from `disabled` to `enforcing` (this works if going from `permissive` to `enforcing`, however flipping from `disabled` -> `enforcing` requires a reboot.)
